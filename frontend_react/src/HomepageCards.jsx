          Solving the problems associated with bottom trawling, including
          bycatch, sediment disruption, and CO2 emissions can be addressed by
          the characteristics of our solution: its hydroacoustic transducers
          (underwater speakers), and its single point of contact system. The
          netâ€™s features also allow users to save fuel, reducing operating
          costs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our solution is designed to help fisheries increase efficiency, reduce
          costs, and operate in a more sustainable way. Our solution uses
          targeted sound emissions to biologically attract groundfish,
          increasing catch selectivity and reducing bycatch. This means
          fisheries can maximize their desired catch while minimizing waste,
          leading to better yields and more sustainable practice.

          Our technology is designed to maintain minimal contact with the
          seabed, significantly reducing sediment disruption and its harmful
          effects on marine ecosystems. By minimizing disturbances to the ocean
          floor, we help preserve delicate habitats that are essential for
          biodiversity and the overall health of marine life. Additionally, our
          approach reduces drag, leading to lower fuel consumption and, in turn,
          decreased operational costs for fisheries. This innovation not only
          enhances the long-term profitability of fishing operations but also
          allows fisheries to actively demonstrate their commitment to more
          sustainable and environmentally responsible practices.
